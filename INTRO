1)Write a function that returns the sum of two numbers.
def solution(param1, param2):
    return param1 + param2

2)Given a year, return the century it is in. The first century spans from the year 1 up to and including the year 100, the second - from the year 101 up to and including the year 200, etc.
def solution(year):
    return (year - 1) // 100 + 1

3)Given the string, check if it is a palindrome.
def solution(inputString):
    left = 0
    right = len(inputString) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        if inputString[left] != inputString[right]:
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    
    return True
